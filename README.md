# Among the Universe

[Among the Universe](https://amongtheuniverse.pythonanywhere.com/) is a website built as a project for the Creatica hackathon, aiming to help users explore thousands of discovered exoplanets (plantes outside of our solar system) in our Universe. Using this website, users can explore main characteristics of planets such their as radius, mass, orbital period, density and discovery method. Additionally, this site also displays an image of the Earth and a sketch of the planet in hand, so users can see how the planet and Earth compare in size. Users can also explore planets with characteristics similar to the Earth.

## Technical:
This website is available [here](https://amongtheuniverse.pythonanywhere.com/), but if you want to run it on your local machines, then the packages in `requirements.txt` must be installed first. Download all files in this repo and run `app.py`. 

## Notes:
The Jupyter Notebook included in this repo does not affect the website, it is just a medium to test the code, in particular to test data management using `Pandas`.
